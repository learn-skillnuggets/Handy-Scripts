Simple python3 scripy that will allow you to ping as many devices as you want.

Subprocess is enabled so the execution of the script will ping 10 devices at once for speed and can ping either IP addresses or resolvable hostnames.

After the script is complete results will be saved in two text files in the same directory as the ping.py and devices.txt
failed-ping.txt 
pingable.txt

Simple to run just do the following:

list your IP / Hostmanes in devices.txt ( one on each line )
run the script with:  Python3 ping.py
