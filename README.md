# Handy-Scripts
A handy set of Python and Networking scripts 

The Config and CSV/XLSX passers require the files to search to be in the same directory as the script.
once the script is run you can access the web front end to complete your searches:
127.0.0.1:5000 for the CSV / XLSX
127.0.0.1:5001 for the Config search

Additional scripts will be  added over time and will be iterated as time goes by
